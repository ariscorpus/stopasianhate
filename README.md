# stopasianhate
Hate crimes fueled beginning around COVID, centered around Asian Americans and Asian business owners, stemming from New York, LA, and Asian centric communities
Asian communities are being empowered from our mapplication. We hope to map areas of crimes to hopefully counteract future attacks.
We could encounter problems with privacy and dealing with private information, making sure communities are properly represented, mainting accurate data regarding the actual crimes, and the internalized fear regarding reporting the actual hate crimes.
